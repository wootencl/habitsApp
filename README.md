# habitsApp
I was working on this iOS application while I was studying abroad in Linz, Austria. Sadly after my departure I had to put it down and have been unable to pick it back up. The gist of the app is to curb (or promote) habits that an individual has.  (Disclaimer: This is really my first iOS app so it was most definitely all a learning experience)
