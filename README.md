# habitsApp
I was working on this iOS application while I was studying abroad in Linz, Austria. Sadly after my departure I had to put it down and have been unable to pick it back up. The gist of the app is to curb (or promote) habits that an individual has.  (Disclaimer: This is really my first iOS app so it was most definitely all a learning experience. I wanted to get it out on the web as I would like to continue creating iOS applications and thought this may help any show potential future employers that I have at minimum some experience).
